  "Doc of w32-shell-execute followed by MSDN doc of ShellExecute Function.\n\n
`w32-shell-execute' is a built-in function in `w32fns.c'.\n
\(w32-shell-execute operation document &optional parameters show-flag\)\n
Get Windows to perform operation on document.
This is a wrapper around the ShellExecute system function, which
invokes the application registered to handle operation for document.\n
operation is either nil or a string that names a supported operation.
What operations can be used depends on the particular document and its
handler application, but typically it is one of the following common
operations:\n
 \"open\"    - Open document, which could be a file, a directory, or an
               executable program.  If it is an application, that
               application is launched in the current buffer's default
               directory.  Otherwise, the application associated with
               document is launched in the buffer's default directory;
 \"print\"   - Print document, which must be a file;
 \"explore\" - Start the Windows Explorer at document;
 \"edit\"    - Launch an editor and open document for editing; which
               editor is launched depends on the association for the
               specified document;
 \"find\"    - Initiate search starting from document which must specify
               a directory;
 \"nil\"     - Invoke the default operation, or \"open\" if default is
               not defined or unavailable;\n
document is typically the name of a document file or a URL, but can
also be a program executable to run, or a directory to open in the
Windows Explorer.\n
If document is a program executable, the optional third arg parameters
can be a string containing command line parameters that will be passed
to the program; otherwise, parameters should be nil or unspecified.\n
Optional fourth argument show-flag can be used to control how the
application will be displayed when it is invoked.  If show-flag is nil
or unspecified, the application is displayed normally, otherwise it is
an integer representing a ShowWindow flag:\n
  0 - start hidden
  1 - start normally
  3 - start maximized
  6 - start minimized\n\n
 ----------------------
`ShellExecute' Function
 ----------------------\n
Performs an operation on a specified file.\n
:SYNTAX\n
    HINSTANCE ShellExecute(      
        HWND hwnd,
        LPCTSTR lpOperation,
        LPCTSTR lpFile,
        LPCTSTR lpParameters,
        LPCTSTR lpDirectory,
        INT nShowCmd
    );\n
:PARAMETERS\n
hwnd
    [in] A handle to the owner window used for displaying a user interface (UI)
    or error messages. This value can be NULL if the operation is not associated
    with a window.\n
lpOperation
    [in] A pointer to a null-terminated string, referred to in this case as a
    verb, that specifies the action to be performed. The set of available verbs
    depends on the particular file or folder. Generally, the actions available
    from an object's shortcut menu are available verbs. The following verbs are
    commonly used:\n
edit
    Launches an editor and opens the document for editing. If lpFile is not a
    document file, the function will fail.\n
explore
    Explores a folder specified by lpFile.\n
find
    Initiates a search beginning in the directory specified by lpDirectory.\n
open
    Opens the item specified by the lpFile parameter. The item can be a file or
    folder.\n
print
    Prints the file specified by lpFile. If lpFile is not a document file, the
    function fails.\n
NULL
    In systems prior to Microsoft Windows 2000, the default verb is used if it
    is valid and available in the registry. If not, the \"open\" verb is used.\n
    In Windows 2000 and later, the default verb is used if available. If not,
    the \"open\" verb is used. If neither verb is available, the system uses the
    first verb listed in the registry.\n
lpFile
    [in] A pointer to a null-terminated string that specifies the file or object
    on which to execute the specified verb. To specify a Shell namespace object,
    pass the fully qualified parse name. Note that not all verbs are supported
    on all objects. For example, not all document types support the \"print\"
    verb. If a relative path is used for the lpDirectory parameter do not use a
    relative path for lpFile.\n
lpParameters
    [in] If lpFile specifies an executable file, this parameter is a pointer to
    a null-terminated string that specifies the parameters to be passed to the
    application. The format of this string is determined by the verb that is to
    be invoked. If lpFile specifies a document file, lpParameters should be
    NULL.\n
lpDirectory
    [in] A pointer to a null-terminated string that specifies the default
    (working) directory for the action. If this value is NULL, the current
    working directory is used. If a relative path is provided at lpFile, do not
    use a relative path for lpDirectory.\n
nShowCmd
    [in] The flags that specify how an application is to be displayed when it is
    opened. If lpFile specifies a document file, the flag is simply passed to
    the associated application. It is up to the application to decide how to
    handle it.\n
SW_HIDE
    Hides the window and activates another window.\n
SW_MAXIMIZE
    Maximizes the specified window.\n
SW_MINIMIZE
    Minimizes the specified window and activates the next top-level window in
    the z-order.\n
SW_RESTORE
    Activates and displays the window. If the window is minimized or maximized,
    Windows restores it to its original size and position. An application should
    specify this flag when restoring a minimized window.\n
SW_SHOW
    Activates the window and displays it in its current size and position.\n
SW_SHOWDEFAULT
    Sets the show state based on the SW_ flag specified in the STARTUPINFO
    structure passed to the CreateProcess function by the program that started
    the application. An application should call ShowWindow with this flag to set
    the initial show state of its main window.\n
SW_SHOWMAXIMIZED
    Activates the window and displays it as a maximized window.\n
SW_SHOWMINIMIZED
    Activates the window and displays it as a minimized window.\n
SW_SHOWMINNOACTIVE
    Displays the window as a minimized window. The active window remains active.\n
SW_SHOWNA
    Displays the window in its current state. The active window remains active.\n
SW_SHOWNOACTIVATE
    Displays a window in its most recent size and position. The active window
    remains active.\n
SW_SHOWNORMAL
    Activate and displays a window. If the window is minimized or maximized,
    Windows restores it to its original size and position. An application should
    specify this flag when displaying the window for the first time.\n
:RETURN-VALUE\n
If the function succeeds, it returns a value greater than 32. If the function
fails, it returns an error value that indicates the cause of the failure. The
return value is cast as an HINSTANCE for backward compatibility with 16-bit
Windows applications. It is not a true HINSTANCE, however. It can be cast only
to an int and compared to either 32 or the following error codes below.\n
0	                The operating system is out of memory or resources.\n
ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND    The specified file was not found.\n
ERROR_PATH_NOT_FOUND    The specified path was not found.\n
ERROR_BAD_FORMAT	The .exe file is invalid (non-Microsoft Win32 .exe
                        or error in .exe image).\n
SE_ERR_ACCESSDENIED	The operating system denied access to the specified
                        file.\n
SE_ERR_ASSOCINCOMPLETE  The file name association is incomplete or invalid.\n
SE_ERR_DDEBUSY	        The Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) transaction
                        could not be completed because other DDE
                        transactions were being processed.\n
SE_ERR_DDEFAIL	        The DDE transaction failed.\n
SE_ERR_DDETIMEOUT       The DDE transaction could not be completed because
                        the request timed out.\n
SE_ERR_DLLNOTFOUND      The specified DLL was not found.\n
SE_ERR_FNF	        The specified file was not found.\n
SE_ERR_NOASSOC	        There is no application associated with the given file name
                        extension. This error will also be returned if you
                        attempt to print a file that is not printable. \n
SE_ERR_OOM	        Not enough memory to complete the operation.\n
SE_ERR_PNF	        The specified path was not found.\n
SE_ERR_SHARE	        A sharing violation occurred.\n
:REMARKS\n
Because ShellExecute can delegate execution to Shell extensions (data sources,
context menu handlers, verb implementations) that are activated using Component
Object Model (COM), COM should be initialized before ShellExecute is
called. Some Shell extensions require the COM single-threaded apartment (STA)
type. In that case, COM should be initialized as shown here:\n
    CoInitializeEx(NULL, COINIT_APARTMENTTHREADED | COINIT_DISABLE_OLE1DDE)\n
There are certainly instances where ShellExecute does not use one of these types
of Shell extension and those instances would not require COM to be initialized
at all. Nonetheless, it is good practice to always initalize COM before using
this function.\n
This method allows you to execute any commands in a folder's shortcut menu or
stored in the registry.\n
To open a folder, use either of the following calls:\n
ShellExecute(handle, NULL, <fully_qualified_path_to_folder>, NULL, NULL, SW_SHOWNORMAL);\n
or\n
ShellExecute(handle, \"open\", <fully_qualified_path_to_folder>, NULL, NULL, SW_SHOWNORMAL);\n
To explore a folder, use the following call:\n
ShellExecute(handle, \"explore\", <fully_qualified_path_to_folder>, NULL, NULL, SW_SHOWNORMAL);\n
To launch the Shell's Find utility for a directory, use the following call.\n
ShellExecute(handle, \"find\", <fully_qualified_path_to_folder>, NULL, NULL, 0);\n
If lpOperation is NULL, the function opens the file specified by lpFile. If
lpOperation is \"open\" or \"explore\", the function attempts to open or explore the
folder.\n
To obtain information about the application that is launched as a result of
calling ShellExecute, use ShellExecuteEx.\n
:NOTE The Launch folder windows in a separate process setting in Folder Options
affects ShellExecute. If that option is disabled (the default setting),
ShellExecute uses an open Explorer window rather than launch a new one. If no
Explorer window is open, ShellExecute launches a new one.\n
