;; ================================================================
;; DESCRIPTION:
;; naf-skeletons provides skeleton templates, keyboard macros and helper functions
;; used by `naf-mode'. This enclose simple skeletons are used to load naf 
;; for '.naf' file templates when in `naf-mode'
;; all headwords defined herein are font-locked by constants defined 
;; elsewhere in the naf-mode*.el files.

;; TODO:
;; Everything in this file should be refactored. We have never really used the
;; features provided by the `define-skeleton' macro (these were the first set
;; procedures implemented by/for `naf-mode' and we really didn't know what we
;; were doing nor was it clear where naf-mode was heading or what it would
;; become. It would be easier and cleaner to either abstract everything here
;; into a macro w/ var lookup or a defclass w/ associated methods. The later
;; would integrate best w/ other features planned and or already implemented in
;; naf-mode.
;;
;; Additionally, the various `*-naf' template types have "field types" which
;; deviate from each other and in some cases there are minor incoconsistencies
;; as to what the particular field indicates and what types of values they
;; should be filled with. As such, when an `*-naf' template is inserted it
;; should be pre-populated with additional help-echo/button text properties to
;; provide usage discussion, xrefs, help, etc.
