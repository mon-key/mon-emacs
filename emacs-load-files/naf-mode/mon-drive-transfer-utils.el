;; :TEMPLATE-DISCUSSION\n
Template for interactively moving large directory trees drives and mount points.

Template is meant to be invoked manually as root as it is generally not safe to
execute these types of commands in a scripted environment when backups are not
available. This is esp. so where these template routines are those typically
used to initialize a _first_ instance of a filesystem backup/transfer involving
the movement of data across non-like filesystems, partitions, drives, etc. Once
such a transition occurs it is obviously easier, safer, more robust to use a
tool like rsync for subsequent operations. Indeed, rsync may be implemented to
accomplish the intial transfer as well. This said, there are situations where
rsync may not be desired esp. w/re some subtle errors and/or bit-rot which may
arise or be introduced when moving across file system types with different
internal representations of charset, filename length, etc. For such situations
`tar' while more conservative may be more appropriate, hence this template :\)

Each delimited `<VARIABLE>' below is replaced by the equivalent values of the
parameter args to `mon-drive-transfer-template-cln-all' as enumerated above.
The template variables outlined below appear unmodified in the elisp variable
`*mon-drive-transfer-template*' and may be inserted to current-buffer for manual
editing/examination with `mon-insert-drive-transfer-template'.

<FROM-MOUNT-POINT> -- The mounted directory or subdir to move;
                      Occurences are replaced by FROM-MOUNT-POINT arg above.

<TO-MOUNT-POINT>   -- A mounted directory/subdir to move <FROM-MOUNT-POINT> to;
                      Occurences are replaced by TO-MOUNT-POINT arg above.
                      :NOTE When <TO-MOUNT-POINT> is a sub-dir of a mount point
                      Pass the TO-MOUNT-POINT-MNT arg in addition to
                      TO-MOUNT-POINT.

<TRANSFER-NOTES-DIR> -- A directory with files related to the transfer 
                        Occurences are replaced by TRANSFER-NOTE-DIR arg above.

   			These include files named:

                        --- <FROM-MOUNT-POINT>-transfer-notes
    		        A record of shell commands used to execute the transfer

                        --- TRANSFER-LOG-<TRANSFER-DATE>
                            A file name to store the output of `script'
                            command.  This file will contain a list the
                            commands executed along with a complete list of
                            all files moved into <TO-MOUNT-POINT> and is
                            useful for error checking and/or future replay.

                       --- <TRANSFER-NOTES-DIR>/<SRC-LOG>
                           <TRANSFER-NOTES-DIR>/<DEST-LOG>
                           File names to store the output of `ls -alR' for
                           subsequent processing with `grep' command to
                           ascertain file/dir counts. IOW each of these logs
                           contains a list of the files and directoris for both
                           <FROM-MOUNT-POINT> and <TO-MOUNT-POINT> and are
                           redundant in that TRANSFER-LOG-<TRANSFER-DATE> also
                           retains such a record. However, _these_ logs are a
                           more granular in their enumeration and may serve as
                           useful in identifying any disconnetcs between
                           SRC<-->DEST.

<USER-ID>:<GROUP-ID> -- The uid and gid to `chown' <TRANSFER-NOTES-DIR> and
                        <TO-MOUNT-POINT> upon completion of transfer
                        Occurences are replaced by USER and GROUP args above.

We executute the following as root user.

- The `script' command records the output;

- The `mount' command ensures that <TO-MOUNT-POINT> is mounted. Most likely this
  is redundant _HOWEVER_ if we don't do this then we wind up moving all the
  files into a directory, the contents of which won't appear when the drive is
  mounted. This happened to me once and it is a real PITA b/c it requires
  re-executing the entire Nn GB transfer again... This prevents that from
  happening.

  :NOTE if <TO-MOUNT-POINT> is a subdirectory of a mount point and you are
  manually frobbing paths (e.g. the \"un-cleaned\" output returned by
  `mon-insert-drive-transfer-template' / `*mon-drive-transfer-template*') you
  should adjust the `mount'/`unmount' commnads accordingly. When using the
  output of `mon-drive-transfer-template-cln-all' by passing the optional arg
  TO-MOUNT-POINT-MNT the difference in paths is automatically adjusted.

- The `du' command is executed twice once on the <FROM-MOUNT-POINT> side, and
  once on the <TO-MOUNT-POINT> side. Assuming everthing transferred correctly
  these should match.

- The `ls' piped command is executed twice: 

   -- once to get the file _and_ directory count;

   -- once to get teh file count _without_ directories;

  This happens on both the <FROM-MOUNT-POINT> and <TO-MOUNT-POINT> sides. 
  Used to verify that all files/dirs transferred correctly. 
  :NOTE the ext4 file system has an extra directory `lost+found' so the the
  counts will always differ by +/- 3 when the <FROM-MOUNT-POINT> was from a
  filesystem that doesn't utilize this feature, e.g. VFAT.

- The `tar' command is piped per file/dir moving these `sparse' format
  preserving permissions etc. the long form is as follows:

    tar --sparse --create --gzip --preserve-permissions --file

  :NOTE on the output side of the pipe the --verbose flag is provided this
  allows the `script' command to record the transfer on a per file/dir basis.

  To move the entire directory as an archive do:

   (cd <FROM-MOUNT-POINT> && tar Scpvf <TO-MOUNT-POINT><TAR-FILE-NAME>.tar .)\n
   Or if you prefer:\n
   tar -C <FROM-MOUNT-POINT> -Scpvf <TO-MOUNT-POINT><TAR-FILE-NAME>.tar .

  :NOTE In this configuration we add the --verbose flag on the
  <FROM-MOUNT-POINT> side as there is no per file/dir decompression to
  <TO-MOUNT-POINT> side instead we move everthing to a single tar file.  

  Also, note that tar doesn't reliably handle _BIG_ fils and may choke in
  situations where (> (total-size <FROM-MOUNT-POINT>) 8GB)

- The sequential invocation of `umount' and `ls' followed by `mount' and `ls' is
  made as a second verification that <TO-MOUNT-POINT> was mounted before the
  transfer (see above).

- The `rm-force -R' is executed to clean out the contents of <FROM-MOUNT-POINT>
  We alias `rm' in ~/.bashrc to `rm -i' to prevent accidents esp. recursive
  removal during interactive shell use. When we know we want to explicitly force
  a `rm' invoking `rm-force' with the `--recrusive' flag. Following is from our
  ~/.bashrc and /root/.bashrc files:

  ,----
  | # Optionally set `--interactive=once' to only prompt once when `--recursive'
  | alias rm=\"rm --interactive\" 
  | alias rm-force=\"rm --force\"
  `----

  So, assuming everything is kosher and the aliases above are visible to your
  interactive shell the above `rm-force -R' will recursively remove the contents
  of <FROM-MOUNT-POINT>. 

  :NOTE There is no good way to \"undo\" such a big `rm'. You should take care
  to verify that this is indeed what is wanted _before_ clobbering a filesystem
  esp. as we're in our backup routine!!!

- The `exit' command stops `script' and writes a session transcript to the file:
  <TRANSFER-NOTES-DIR>/TRANSFER-LOG-<DATE>

- The `chown' command on <TRANSFER-NOTES-DIR> is invoked because we are root
  (or running w/ root priveleges). Set <USER-ID>:<GROUP-ID> as needed.

- The `cp' moves a log of our transfer into <TO-MOUNT-POINT> for later review.

- The second `chown' sets the permissions of all files/dir in <TO-MOUNT-POINT>
  to something sensible.

- Now we're done.
