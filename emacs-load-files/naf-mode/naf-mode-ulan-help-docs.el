;; DESCRIPTION:
;; naf-mode-ulan-help-docs provides NON-POSTING help docs related to use of
;; ULAN data in naf-mode.  The docs originate from the getty website or a
;; J.P. Getty Trust affiliates.  The docs are verbose and it is considered
;; overkill to include them in :FILE "naf-mode-ulan-utils.el"

  "Valuse identified by regexps in `naf-mode-db-field-flags-ulan-paren',.\n\n
ULAN-PREFERRED-FLAG:
'preferred' following a role indicates that the role is the so-called
'preferred' role for the record. It is typically the first in a list of roles
for the artist. A preferred role is flagged in order to provide a default role
for displays.\n
NON-PREFERRED-PARENTS-FLAG:
The [N] flage indicates 'non-preferred' parent. Names may have multiple
hierarchical views because ULAN is polyhierarchical. One parent is considered
'preferred,' and other parents are 'non-preferred.' When names are displaying
with their non-preferred parent, an 'N' in square brackets appears to the right
as [N].\n
HISTORICAL-FLAG:
Indicates if the Role is current or historical. Currently in ULAN, most roles
are flagged 'N/A' for Not Applicable. Possible values are:
C -> Current
H -> Historical
B -> Both current and historical
U -> Unknown
NA -> Not Applicable\n
PREFERRED-NATIONALITY-FLAG:
'preferred' following a nationality indicates that this is the nationality most
commonly associated with the artist. Note that nationality is not a legalistic
designation; it does not necessarily indicate citizenship of a particular
nation, empire, or city state.\n
HIERARCHICAL-RELATIONSHIP-FLAG:
Indicates if the link to the parent is current, historical, or of another type.
C -> Current
H -> Historical
B -> Both current and historical
U -> Unknown
NA -> Not Applicable 
BTP -> part/whole relationship
BTI -> genus/species relationship
BTG -> generic relationship\n
LC-FLAG:
Indicates if this is the name used in preferred headings in Library of Congress
authorities. Also called the 'AACR2 flag.'
NA -> Not applicable.\n
REPRESENTATIVE-IMAGES-FLAG:
In a proof-of-concept, a selected small number of vocabulary records have been
linked to images in the Getty collections. Further development of this project
will take place in 2009-2010.\n
VERNACULAR-FLAG:
Indicates if the name is in the vernacular (local) language or some other
language. Currently in the ULAN, most names are flagged 'V'.  Diacritics: If a
box displays instead of a character in a name or term, this means that your
system cannot display the Unicode character represented.\n
V = Vernacular
O = Other
U = Undetermined\n
